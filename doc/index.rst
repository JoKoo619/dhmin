User's manual
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These documents give a general overview and help you getting started from after
the installation (which is covered in the `README.md`_ file on GitHub) to you
first running model.

Features
--------
* `dhmin`_ is a mixed-integer linear programming model for single-commodity
  energy distribution networks. 
* It finds the minimum cost (invest + operation - revenue) energy distribution
  network for a given set of energy source locations (source vertices) and a
  set of demand locations (possible customers).
* Temporal resolution is variable, but incurs a strong limit on the feasible
  spatial resolution. I.e. with about 2-3 timesteps, hundreds or several 
  thousand edges are possible in reasonable time.
* Thanks to `pandas`_ and `GeoPandas`_ complex data analysis code is short and
  concise.
* The model code itself is very short thanks to relying on the `Pyomo`_
  package.
* The model code is structured identical to the more general `urbs`_ model.

This is a typical result plot created by function `dhmintools.plot_flows_min`
for the accompanying minimal example dataset. There are (not shown) two demand
edges (with x,y coordinates [5,7 to 4,9] and [7,2 to 6,3]) in this graph. 
Three possible source vertices (red dots) with sufficient capacity are located 
at the vertices with coordinates [2,2] [2,7] [9,9] and feature different
generation costs, [9,9] being cheaper than the other two.

The first subplot **Pmax** shows the power flow from the cheapest source vertex
(north east) to the two demand locations, indicating that both locations can be
connected economcially. The two plots **t1040** and **t1600** show the
minimum-cost power flow configuration for the provided partial load situations.

The second row shows the power flow configuration that occur when outages of
the source vertices occur. As only vertex [9,9] is used exclusively anyway,
only its outage (last plot) changes the

The built pipe capacity and layout is planned so that a) satisfying all
profitable demands at minimum costs and b) that all pre-determined contigency
situations can be handled with the constructed capacities. 

Dependencies
------------

* `Python`_ versions 2.7 or 3.x are both supported.
* `pyomo`_ for model equations and as the interface to optimisation solvers 
  (CPLEX, GLPK, Gurobi, ...). Version 4 recommended, as version 3 support
  (a.k.a. as coopr.pyomo) will be dropped soon.
* `pandas`_ for input and result data handling, report generation 
* Any solver supported by pyomo (GLPK, CBC, CPLEX, Gurobi,Â ...)
